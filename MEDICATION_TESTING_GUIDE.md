## 🎯 Overview

Your medication notification system is now fully implemented with comprehensive testing capabilities. This guide shows you exactly how to verify everything is working properly.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Medication reminder scheduling (Morning, Evening, Night)
- ✅ Custom frequency support ("Every 4 hours", "Twice a day", etc.)
- ✅ Mark-as-taken functionality to prevent duplicate notifications
- ✅ 10-minute notification windows (notifications sent when due within 10 minutes)

### Smart Features

- ✅ Prevents notifications if medication already marked as taken
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old reminders
- ✅ Time validation and error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🧪 How to Test the System

### Method 1: Using the Test Buttons in Your App

1. **Open your app** and navigate to the Medication Management screen
2. **Scroll to the bottom** - you'll see a gray section with test buttons
3. **Use these test buttons:**

   - **🔍 Full Test**: Runs all system tests and shows results in console
   - **🔔 Test Alert**: Sends an immediate test notification
   - **⏰ 2:21 PM**: Schedules a test reminder for 2:21 PM (your requested time)
   - **📊 Status**: Shows current system status and upcoming reminders
   - **🧹 Clean**: Removes all test data (use after testing)

### Method 2: Using the Terminal (Advanced)

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "c:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\Sashi\Samasha"

# Run the test script
node test-medication-system.js
```

### Method 3: Console Testing (Developer)

Open your app's developer console and run:

```javascript
// Import the testing functions
import {
  runComprehensiveTest,
  testSpecificTimeScheduling,
  getSystemStatus,
} from "./utils/MedicationNotificationService";

// Run comprehensive test
runComprehensiveTest();

// Test specific time (2:21 PM)
testSpecificTimeScheduling(14, 21);

// Check system status
getSystemStatus();
```

## 🚀 Real-World Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Immediate Notification

1. Press **🔔 Test Alert** button
2. You should see a notification immediately
3. ✅ **Expected**: Success notification appears

### Scenario 2: Test Your 2:21 PM Requirement

1. Press **⏰ 2:21 PM** button
2. Check console for confirmation
3. Wait until 2:21 PM (if today) or check tomorrow
4. ✅ **Expected**: Notification at exactly 2:21 PM

### Scenario 3: Test Mark-as-Taken Prevention

1. Schedule a medication for Morning (8:00 AM)
2. Go to "Mark as Taken" screen
3. Mark that medication as taken
4. ✅ **Expected**: No notification at 8:00 AM

### Scenario 4: Test 10-Minute Intervals

1. Schedule a medication
2. Monitor system behavior
3. ✅ **Expected**: System checks every 10 minutes, sends notifications when due

## 📊 Monitoring System Health

### Check System Status

Press the **📊 Status** button to see:

- Total number of reminders
- Active reminders count
- Medications taken today
- Next 3 upcoming reminders

### Console Monitoring

Watch the console for these messages:

```
✓ Storage test passed - loaded reminders: X
✓ Default times: [object showing correct times]
✓ Notification creation test passed
✓ Medication marked as taken: true
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail:

1. **Check Permissions**:

   - Ensure notification permissions are granted
   - Check storage permissions

2. **Clear Storage** (if needed):

   ```javascript
   import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";
   AsyncStorage.clear();
   ```

3. **Check Console Errors**:

   - Look for red error messages
   - Check network connectivity for AWS calls

4. **Restart App**:
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Clear app cache if needed

### Common Issues and Solutions:

| Issue                      | Solution                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| No notifications appearing | Check notification permissions             |
| Times are wrong            | Verify DEFAULT_TIMES configuration         |
| Storage errors             | Clear AsyncStorage and restart             |
| Mark-as-taken not working  | Check MedicationMarkAsTaken.js integration |
